# Equity-premium-prediction-with-Machine-Learning
For this project I worked with Elise Gourier, an Associate Professor in Finance at ESSEC Business School in Paris. The aim was to provide empirical results for the publication of one of her upcoming papers. The repo comprises one notebook gathering all the implemented functions and another visualizing the results. </br> </br> In the context of time series data, traditional Machine Learning techniques have been applied to predict subsequent observations of Equity Premium (computed from the S&P $500$ index), on an expanding window basis. The objective was to evaluate the predictive power of engineered Pricing Kernel variables (point, slope and curve) based on the recent literature. The broadness of the problem allowed to try many different approaches, the results have been satisfactory and the implemented analytical tools will continue to be used during her research.
